                    <p>We’re a home for musicians, songwriters, producers, engineers, fans, and people passionate about creating music from all over the world.  Singers in Nashville can collaborate with guitarists in London.  Producers in New York can discover songwriters from Atlanta or Minneapolis. Our search engines are crafted specifically for musicians to find their best creative matches, whether at home or anywhere in the world.</p>

                    <h3>2. FMS is a place to showcase your musical work</h3>
                    <p>We believe that every artist deserves a well-designed portfolio to show the world who they are and what they’ve accomplished.  That’s why every person on FindMySong gets an expertly-crafted personal profile, and that’s why every project gets its own showcase to be displayed in your personal portfolio.  Music is meant to be shared, and we built FindMySong to help people around the world discover you and your music.</p>

                    <h3>3. FMS helps remove location as a barrier to making music</h3>
                    <p>We put talented creators together, wherever you are.  But that’s not enough to break down the walls that stop creative work online.  That’s why we created FindMySong projects.  A project is a new home for your work - a place to keep everything you need organized while you work. Save your friends as contacts, and keep your professional connections looped in on your new projects.  Audition new people to make sure they’re the perfect fit. Keep a permanent archive of old projects so you never lose them. And above all, have fun!</p>

                    <h3>4. FMS keeps you safe with simple, personal contracts - no 360º deals here</h3>
                    <p>The music industry is notoriously complex, frustrating, and prone to taking advantage of artists.  Bypass the gatekeepers and the profiteers by managing your own contracts in FindMySong. Keep 100% ownership of your works, or decide how much you want to give to your fellow artists.</p>
